# Speech-enhancement-using-special-substraction
Speech Enhancement with Spectral Subtraction: MATLAB project implementing spectral subtraction method to enhance speech quality by reducing noise. Includes audio loading, visualization, and processing for improved speech intelligibility.

This MATLAB project implements the spectral subtraction method for enhancing speech quality by reducing noise. It includes functionality for loading audio files, visualizing original and enhanced spectrograms, and processing audio signals.

## Features

- Load audio files in WAV format.
- Visualize original and enhanced spectrograms.
- Apply spectral subtraction for noise reduction.
- Plot original and enhanced speech signals.
- Save enhanced speech as a WAV file.

## Requirements

- MATLAB R2019a or later.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `cp.m` file to launch the Speech Enhancement app.
4. Click "Load Audio" to select an audio file.
5. Adjust the threshold slider if necessary.
6. Click "Enhance" to apply spectral subtraction and view the results.
